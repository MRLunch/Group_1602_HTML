        What is a Smart City?<br><br>
    <h3>
       
    <h4>
        <font size = 6>A</font> smart city can be defined as an urban area that uses information and communication technology (ICT) to become more efficient, more environmentally friendly or more socially inclusive (Wade & Pf√§ffli, 2016). The main goal of a smart city is to optimise city functions and services while promoting economic growth and providing a better quality of life for its citizens through the use of ICTs like Artificial Intelligence and data analytics  (TWI Global, 2020).<br><br>
        Smart surveillance, is the use of automatic video and audio analysis technologies in video and audio surveillance applications. With technology advancing rapidly throughout the years, smart devices have become extremely common. With the mainstream implementation of surveillance cameras, loT and monitoring devices throughout many major cities around the world, privacy has become a major concern for people. This is because traditional gadgets are modernised and are a lot more appealing to the younger users of technology since the use of technology has become a lot more common in the recent years. As an example, traditional speakers are now getting replaced with smart speakers with built in artificial intelligence assistants like Alexa and Google Home.<br><br>
        Although these improved gadgets come with many advantages, the line between what data can and cannot be collected from the user is often a blurred line. This is because the requirements and permissions of these devices are often not efficiently regulated due to them being relatively new.<br><br><br><br>
