<font size = 6>A</font>s more digital surveillance tools become widely available, governments can better control crime and
gather evidence. Digital surveillance systems have also made great contributions to improve traffic conditions. However, 
these ever-changing digital surveillance tools are constantly violating people's privacy and may even be abused by some 
private organizations, such as selling personal data to various companies for more targeted advertisements. For example, 
if a smart device hears the user talk about buying a new car, this information can be sold to car dealership companies 
without the permission of the user. The advertisements that are presented to the user will then be more in tune with 
userâ€™s needs, hence they might see advertisements about cars for sale in various applications that are regularly used by 
many people e.g Instagram, Facebook etc. <br><br><br><br></h4>
