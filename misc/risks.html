            Privacy Risk in Using Technology<br><br>
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Humans place a great value on personal privacy and security. They value having some level of control over who knows what about them. They do not want their personal information to be accessible at all times. Recent advancements in information technology, on the other hand, have created a threat to privacy by lowering personal data control and allowing for a variety of negative consequences as a result of personal data access. The use of technology has generally brought advantages and carried security and privacy risks in almost all aspects.<br><br>

            Data protection regulations arose as the processing of personal data became more frequent in the second part of the twentieth century. Two examples of how the twenty-first century has grown into the century of big data and advanced information technology are the platform economy, which involves storing and processing exabytes of data, and deep learning. Government agencies and corporations now have the technological power to collect, store, and analyze huge amounts of data generated by phone calls, internet searches, and electronic payments.<br><br>

            Many individuals are concerned about China's ascent and the widespread adoption of advanced digital monitoring and control technology. During the currency pandemic, Invasive state surveillance has become a major concern with epidemiological tracking measures. It is a government practice to monitor, collect, or process personal data. Despite its use for containing Coronavirus, such surveillance of people's location, activities, and biometrics also significantly expands the government’s power with greater social and political control. Infringing on fundamental rights like freedom of expression is a risk associated with this type of control. Personal information on current and potential customers has become a valuable resource for organizations. Drones, wearable sensors, sensor networks, social media, smartphones, closed-circuit television, government cybersecurity programs, direct marketing, RFID tags, Big Data, head-mounted displays, and search engines are all potentially vulnerable (Jeroen et al, 2020).<br><br>

            As technology pervades society via Internet sites, smartphones, social networks, and other means, issues about whether lines are being crossed are being addressed. People spend the majority of their time using various forms of technology to distribute information about themselves and others. The issue with all of these variations is that there is no reliable method of knowing what data is being gathered and how it is being used. Users of this innovative technology have little influence over the fate of this information, but they can choose whether or not to release it into the cyber world. There is no doubt that when technology gets increasingly integrated into one's life, one's privacy in the cyber world suffers. The question being raised is: is today's technology depleting the level of privacy that each member of society has? Because of the amount of personal information released on social networks, smartphones, and Google Street View mapping, technology has reduced our privacy in today's society. All of these aspects include society's tendency to provide other technology users with information about daily occurrences. The information that will be provided in this paper deals with assessing how technology impacts privacy.<br><br>

            The first aspect being addressed is the problem with social networking sites exposing information. Social networking has created an environment where it is nearly a duty to expose oneself. Profiles on these social websites are updated every day with personal information such as locations, status, and future plans. Anyone can search for another’s name and find information about their history, pictures, and activities (Soo, 2022).<br><br>

            Agents' ability to act based on new sources of information rises as connectivity enhances access to information. When these sources contain personal data, there is a high danger of injury, inequity, discrimination, and loss of autonomy. For example, the persons’ enemies may have an easier time tracking them down; users may be enticed to give up privacy in exchange for perceived benefits in online environments, and businesses may use internet data to avoid hiring specific groups of people. Furthermore, systems, rather than users, may choose which information is broadcast, presenting individuals with just news that suits their profiles. Although information technology functions at the device level, it is a complex system of socio-technical practices, and understanding its role in changing access to information and thus jeopardizing privacy begins with understanding its context of use (Jeroen et al, 2020).<br><br>

            Cloud computing's rapid development has heightened several privacy concerns. Previously, while information was accessible via the internet, user data and programs were still stored locally, denying program suppliers access to data and usage statistics. Both data and programs are available in the cloud with cloud computing, and it is not always clear what the user-generated and system-generated data is used for. Furthermore, because data is stored in many parts of the world, it is not always clear which laws apply and which agencies might seek access to the data. Data gathered by online services and apps such as search engines and games are of particular concern here. Which data used and communicated by applications like browsing history, contact lists, etc., is not always clear, and even when it is, the only choice available to the user may be not to use the application (Jeroen et al, 2020).<br><br>

            These are just a few examples of how modern technology has been integrated into our daily life. While users appreciate the advantages and convenience they give, it must be remembered that threats, like technology, are always changing. Future technology may have much more devastating repercussions. Not only would behavioural features be exposed to privacy problems if computers were connected directly to the brain, but one's thoughts might potentially become public, affecting others' decisions. It may also be possible to change one's behaviour by utilizing such technologies. As a result, such developments necessitate a deeper examination of the grounds for privacy protection.<br><br>
