           <font size = 6>T</font>oday most cities around the world are growing faster than their infrastructure can handle, and with the population constantly growing this is likely to be the case for years to come. Fortunately, implementing IoT technologies and ‘creating’ smart cities does not require massive infrastructural changes. And although currently there is no particular ‘blue-print’ approach a city should follow to become a smart city one of the most important factors is for cities to develop reliable strategic plans and to take a holistic development approach which will ultimately result in a well rounded solution (Nuaimi, Neyadi, Mohamed, Jaroodi 2015).<br><br>
		
		To fully successfully implement and develop the Information and Communication Technologies necessary to support smart cities, local councils and governments will face many challenging choices. To ensure a proper implementation of these technologies there are seven key choices that should not be overlooked:<br><br>
		 <ol>
            <li>Develop a clear roadmap that plans for future growth and the implementation of new technologies. Ensure proper modelling is done to facilitate the best choice.</li>
            <li>Introduce proper guidelines and legislations regarding these technologies, along with defining privacy and usage of data laws.</li>
            <li>Redesign the city infrastructure plan to build smart-ready infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Build the physical infrastructure required to support these systems now and in the future (5G connectivity, monitors, sensors, cameras, big data stores, etc.)</li>
            <li>Choose which problems negatively affect the city the most (urban mobility, safety and security, etc.) and implement the systems to solve these issues first.</li>
            <li>Using data collected from implemented systems, select which services are performing the best. If an implemented system is underperforming a choice can be made regarding its improvement.</li>
      	    <li>Ensure these changes are mindful of the environment and provide environmental improvements.</li>
		</ol> <br>
