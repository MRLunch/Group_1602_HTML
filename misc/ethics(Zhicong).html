<p> Since the invention of the computer, almost every technological innovation has triggered a new moral and ethical discussion. With the widespread use of smart devices and the Internet of Things, people have become inseparable from this smart network system, and personal information digitization and privacy issues have gradually become the core of the discussion.</p>

<p> The main reason why smart devices and IOT are related to people's privacy is that during the operation of this smart network system, small embedded devices loaded with sensors collect information from the surrounding environment, process it, and forwarded these information to a remote location for further analysis (Orlando Arias, et al., 2015). Although many large companies have declared to the public that they will carefully look after the end users’ information and ensure that they will not be leaked. However, no one knows whether people's information is well looking after or not, and where the information eventually goes.</p> 
	
<p>	Smart devices and IoT have received great attention and adoption in almost all fields, such as education, manufacturing, healthcare, entertainment, commerce, energy distribution, smart cities and smart homes (Mohamed Abdel-Basset, et al., 2022). Our daily lives are surrounded by a variety of sensors that measure, monitor, collect and send data from people in different forms to help people save time, energy and money. But people are also unknowingly exposing their privacy at the same time.</p>
	
<p>	In November 2015, a 47-year-old former police officer in Arkansas, USA, died in the bathtub of a friend's house while attending a family party organized by a friend. After the police arrived at the scene, they launched an intensive investigation and wanted to find out if it is an accident or murder. However, no one thought that an Amazon Echo on the scene would be involved and become the key to solving the case (Nicole Chavez, 2017). Echo is a smart speaker device product from Amazon, it’s also a control center for smart homes. It connected to Amazon's artificial intelligence platform and supports voice control of human-machine dialogue. End users can activate Echo by calling "Alexa" and give it commands, such as turn on the air conditioner, play the weather forecast, news, etc. In other words, the Amazon Echo is recording all day, waiting for commands from its owner. The police department in Arkansas issued a search warrant to Amazon, because they were told someone heard the music from the Amazon Echo on the night of the crime. Amazon initially refused to provide data from the suspect's Echo, but then the suspect voluntarily authorized Amazon to provide the voice data to the police, and the judge eventually dropped the suspect's murder charge based on information provided by Amazon.</p>
	
<p>	Although Amazon's Echo solved the murder case this time. However, people start to think of how much of their conversations are unknowingly recorded by the Echo and uploaded to the cloud. Thankfully, Amazon has posted some tips on how to prevent personal privacy from being uploaded to the cloud and how to delete recordings on the official website. Even so, some things that happened later still made people worry about the privacy and security risks of these smart speakers. For example, Amazon’s Alexa mistakenly sent 1,700 recording to a wrong person (Irina Ivanova, 2018).</p>
	
<p>	In addition, Amazon's echo smart speaker is so powerful that it can be used with Amazon’s Alexa smart voice assistant as the control center of the smart home, connecting with other smart appliances at home. However, this not only brings convenience to people, but also brings a hidden danger to people's privacy and security. Because if end users do not set up these smart devices properly, hackers can easily hack into these devices to control their home cameras, smart TVs, computers, and even open smart door locks (Which? Investigates, 2021). </p>
	
<p>	In recent years, smart watches have become increasingly popular. According to a report from Strategy Analytics, Apple smart watches have a 40% increase in sales from 2019 to 2020 (David Curry, 2022). But at the same time, some research reports found that the 2019 version of the Apple smartwatch will monitor the user's heart rate and irregularities, steps, elevation, hydration, sleep amount and quality, caloric intake and expenditure by default. And the smart watch will also allow apps from third-party developers to track user information, such as medication intake and menstrual cycles. This has raised concerns among end users and regulators (Devjani Sen and Rukhsana Ahmed, 2021).</p>
	
<p>	The reason for using Amazon echo and Apple Watches as examples is because they are both large companies, and their products are relatively mature, but these privacy loopholes still appear. The situation may be even worse for those smart products made by smaller companies and unknown brands.</p>
	
<p>	Smart devices and the Internet of Things have grown too fast in the past few years. Industry, academia, and people are all trying to integrate the stream of rapid commercialization with little regard for the security and privacy of IoT data and devices (Mohamed Abdel-Basset, et al., 2022). </p>
	
<p>	As more and more consumers begin to concern about these smart devices will reveal their personal privacy, manufacturers must pay more attention to the protection of user privacy when developing and designing products. As mentioned earlier, hacking is another threat to user data privacy, developers should also take appropriate countermeasures and reduce the possibility of such data leakage as much as possible (Devjani Sen and Rukhsana Ahmed, 2021). Moreover, suppliers have obligations to let consumers fully understand the products, and how to setup the devices properly. In addition, policymakers should also continue to improve the laws on smart products to urge suppliers and third-party developers become more rigorously when dealing with consumers' information.</p></h4>
