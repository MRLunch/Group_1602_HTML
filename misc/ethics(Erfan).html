<font size = 6>T</font>here is no doubt that with the advance in technology, all of us have been involved in a world where someone else has control of our data and so far, we do not know how to handle it. This is easily verifiable. For example, when you do a search on the internet for a product you want to buy. Having done this, when you continue browsing the internet and visit other different pages, you see advertisements for offers of products that are similar to the ones you have already bought. In fact, without the need to buy, just by searching, they already know what product you want and most of the advertising that is offered to you on the pages you visit is based on the searches you have already made previously. There have been many instances when I shop online and after buying an item or searching for it, I see more recommendations about the same item many times, not only on the same website but also in other unrelated apps and websites which use advertisements as a source of revenue. Voice-assisted search and facial recognition are other examples of this. These devices bring us the benefit of improving our environment and makes ordinary tasks easier to do, but they can unknowingly collect our data or our conversations or the details of our faces and use it for malicious purposes. As an example, I use the Siri and Alexa smart assistants on a daily basis, these assistants can easily collect personal data such as conversations and plans about the future. There have been instances where I verbally talked about buying new televisions, and I would get more personalised advertisements that suggested new televisions that were on sale. I also use functions like fingerprint ID or face ID nowadays on many modern devices in order to unlock them or make purchases, these biometric data can also be used by the government or law enforcement. It is incredible how in some countries there are already cameras and microphones to spy on people and monitor their behaviour. And this is widely used in dictatorship states. There is no control over your privacy, so it is normal that your rights are violated. I think this is an important point that needs to be addressed. So far it has not been possible to establish control in this regard and it is relevant to the fact that, although it has not been possible to control everything, technology continues to advance and we continue to buy and approve these devices despite them not being completely regulated. The use of devices inside our houses has been a clear security threat. For example, many cases have been observed where the cameras that we buy to watch the house are hacked and then they manage to see inside. A Ring camera that was used to watch an 8-year-old child was hacked and used to harass her (Chiu, 2019). Many times we control all the devices in the house through our cell phones. So if a person manages to hack your cell phone, or if it is stolen, they could access everything you have connected there. This had once become a major concern for me since I had installed an internet-connected security camera in my room for security. However, after finding out about the risks to privacy, I decided to turn it off since I could not completely verify the integrity of the camera and whether it was collecting personal data or not. Normally it should be verified whether the product we buy is safe or not. There is already a verification of certain brands that are hackable or others that are not so hackable. This would be the first step to being able to control our vulnerability at home.</p><br>

<p>As technology advances, it inevitably becomes riskier. Controls need to be put in place to allow users to control other people's access to their devices. This is largely the responsibility of the manufacturers. They should establish user and password controls for the equipment and not put passwords in common use, as we have already seen cases. It is also the user's responsibility to manage the devices correctly, to know what level of security they have, and to make sure to constantly change the access data, so that it is much more difficult to hack them. We are in an era of growth, so it is necessary to make good use of these devices. Governments must be guarantors of the security and proper use of the devices used for mass control.</p>
