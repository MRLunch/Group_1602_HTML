<font size = 6>W</font>ith the ever growing population and the constant demand for better and more efficient cities governments are turning to the implementation of new technologies to increase efficiency, sustainability and security. This combined with the current  mainstream adoption of new technologies, and the implementation of ICT compatible infrastructure within cities has opened the door for the full development of smart cities.</p><br>

<p>Over the last two decades we’ve experienced some of the most groundbreaking advancements in technology, and with computers becoming faster, more reliable than ever before we’ve started to see these technological advancements implemented into our everyday lives. Nowadays over five billion people use the internet worldwide and over four billion use and have access to some form of Artificial Intelligence system (Siri, Alexa) (Internet Users in the World 2022 | Statista, 2022). The fast mainstream adoption of new technologies combined with the need for more effective data driven societies has made the idea of smart cities a reality.It is undeniable that the implementation of these new technologies can have a great positive effect on the efficiency, sustainability, economy, and security of cities. But unfortunately, the implementation of these new technologies poses many risks and challenges in regards to the privacy of citizens, the responsibility of governments, and the protection and use of big data.</p> 

  <p>The main issues surrounding the implementation of these technologies revolves around the lack of privacy smart surveillance and tracking systems impose on citizens, as introducing these systems would give governments immense control over the everyday life of citizens. A clear example of this can be seen in China’s implementation of a ‘Social Credit’ system, in which the government uses advanced facial recognition technology and tracking software to essentially spy or monitor every citizen's move. The Chinese’s government implementation of this system reads citizens behaviours and adds or deducts points for things like jaywalking and bad driving which can then affect a person's livelihood, credit limits, internet speeds etc. Additionally, without the proper regulatory frameworks in place these systems can easily be misused and due to the sensitivity of the information again it would be citizens' livelihoods that would be affected.</p><br>
  
  <p>Aside from privacy concerns, the implementation of these technologies also brings the question of who would be responsible if one of these AI systems were to malfunction?  In the past, there have been instances where advanced AI systems have failed. An example of this can be the 2018 death of Elaine Herzberg, while performing a self driving test on a Tesla the system malfunctioned and did not recognize a pedestrian (Elaine) crossing the road while pushing a bicycle which ultimately led to Elaine’s death. This brought questions as to the liability when situations like these occur, in this particular case the fault fell on the driver which also failed to react in time even though the Tesla malfunctioned. If critical city services were relying on Artificial Intelligence systems and an error were to occur the outcome can be catastrophic and so before these systems can be fully implemented failsafes and regulations must be implemented.</p><br>
  
  <p>Although there are many risks that come with the implementation of these new technologies the benefits that these technologies can bring to our society definitely outweigh the costs. In order for these technologies to be implemented strict regulations and moral grounds should be established to preserve the livelihood and wellbeing of citizens. After all, the development of these technologies is meant to deliver a higher quality of life, and they might be our only solution to coping with the upcoming increases in population and the need for the increase of sustainability within cities.</p>
