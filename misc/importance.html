<h4>
<font size = 6>T</font>he use of technology for surveillance purposes, would affect many people's way of living and their habits in life. Understanding the benefits of
technology and the security risks that comes with it is extremely important to be able to create a well-rounded balance between the two and reduce loss of privacy. The 
implementation of smart surveillance systems have the ability to drastically improve security and efficiency within cities but at the cost of peopleâ€™s right to
privacy. For example, more cameras in the city would mean crimes would occur less, however, these cameras can also be used to analyse behaviour, which can be used to
collect data about people and their way of life. This would allow the government to have more control over the citizens and also gives the government the ability to abuse this power in many ways.</h4>
