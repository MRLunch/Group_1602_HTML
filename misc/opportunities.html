        Technology Opportunities<br><br>
    </h2>
    <h4>
        With the wide use of smart devices, a powerful smart network was formed when these devices collect and share the data, it is an important part of IoT (Internet of Things). The smart network system can increase energy efficiency and bring convenience to people through remote monitoring their smart furniture. With proper monitoring the supply of energy and water, it will help save resources and detect water leaks, unexpected overloads, etc (Joel J. P. C. Rodrigues, et al., 2019). In Europe, households consume 26.3% of the European Union’s total energy consumption. In United States, the energy used by households in 2020 is approximately 20.75 Quadrillion British thermal units. And this consumption is only going to get bigger due to the growing population and the creation of new cities (Zakaria, et al., 2022). And if most of the households are installed with smart home system, this problem can be solved very well, not only saving money and improving energy efficiency, but also reducing carbon footprint, this is in line with our future development.<br><br>

        In addition, smart network system can also offer a high level of security by linking such as motion detectors, surveillance cameras and smart door locks throughout your home or your business and inform the police or security company when break-ins. Over the years, many surveillance methods have been developed because of the technological advancement, many different techniques have been evolved and led to more sophisticated devices and systems making life at easy and safe (Joel J. P. C. Rodrigues, et al., 2019).<br><br>

        The benefits brought by the smart system make more and more families start to install smart home products. According to a data released by Research and Markets, Australia Smart Home Market will be US$ 4.61 Billion by year 2027 from US$ 2.01 Billion in 2020, and growing at a staggering CAGR of 12.59% during 2020-2027 (Research and Markets. 2021).<br><br>

        The smart health monitoring system is being developed, it enables doctors to monitor their patients more precisely and provide better treatments. In the past, patients have to check their blood pressure, ECG (electrocardiograph) or even blood glucose level before they can see their doctors. But nowadays, patients can use their wearable devices, PDA（Personal digital assistant）applications and smart sensors at home and send these data to their doctors (Joel J. P. C. Rodrigues, et al., 2019), and the doctors can consult their patients remotely through live video calls and give a proper advice if any issue happens. It is providing an additional option for patients who have difficulty in moving. The smart network system also played an important role during the Covid-19 pandemic. Patients can operate remotely to making an appointment to see a doctor and getting prescription, which reduces the risk of virus transmission and provides convenience for patients.<br><br>

        Since smart devices and smart surveillance systems are becoming more and more familiar tools in our lives, researchers are starting to explore the use of these tools to solve the population aging problem (Sara Paiva, Suman Paul. 2020). For example, the smart home systems can facilitate the elderly to remotely control various devices at home. They can easily switch the heating system on and off by just saying a word. In addition, the smart health system also greatly reduces operating costs and manpower for hospitals while maintaining the same service quality to the elderly patients.<br><br>

        Apart from the population aging problem, the increasing urban population is also one of the problems that needs to be solved urgently. As we all know, more and more people are migrating to big cities due to better living environment and more job opportunities. The increase of urban population means that the number of personal cars also increases, which brings huge pressure on urban traffic. In big cities, the development space of car roads is very limited, which leads to the problem of traffic jams in many big cities in the world. And the traffic problem is restricting the development of cities. Smart Traffic System, also known as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) can effectively solve this problem. ITS collects data from sensors on the road, such as the car's GPS, roadside cameras, etc. After collecting vehicle speed, vehicle position, delay time and other data, it will be sent to the Data Analysis Center. The Data Analysis Center will summarize and correct all the data, and then send the information to the Traffic Management Center for further operation and control purposes. Fast and real-time monitoring is the key to implementing Intelligent Transport Systems. ITS can also send real-time information, such as road accidents, route changes and road work information to the end-user's electronic devices.
        In addition, research shows that the use of ITS in road transport can increase the capacity of the transport infrastructure (an average increase of 22.5%), improve road traffic safety (a significant 50% reduction in accidents in built areas), and reduce travel time and energy consumption (approximately 60%), improving the natural environment (reducing exhaust emissions by an average of 40%) and improving the comfort of drivers and people using public transport and pedestrians (Grzegorz Sierpiński, 2020).<br><br>

        Today, smart devices and smart surveillance system are used in different scenarios, from smart cities to smart homes, smart appliances and toys, from the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to smart agriculture and smart factories. It will be globally connected to each other and the end users to help entities and users make better decisions based on the data retrieved from these systems (Prasant Kumar et al., 2020). While the smart network enables the rapid development of our society, it is also becoming inseparable from our lives.<br><br>
